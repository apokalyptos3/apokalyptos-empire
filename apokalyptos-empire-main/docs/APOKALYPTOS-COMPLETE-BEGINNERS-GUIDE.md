## PART 1: UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS

### What is a Web Application?

Think of a web application like a website, but instead of just reading information, you can actually DO things with it. Examples you already know:
- Gmail (you can send emails)
- Facebook (you can post content)
- Netflix (you can watch videos)

APOKALYPTOS is a web application that helps you create content for YouTube, TikTok, etc.

### What Are We Building?

We're creating YOUR personal content empire management system. It will:
1. Help you write stories (with ATOPIA as your writing partner)
2. Turn your stories into videos automatically
3. Upload videos to YouTube, TikTok, etc.
4. Track how much money you're making
5. Optimize costs automatically

### What Do You Need?

**Required:**
- Computer with internet
- Email address
- 4-6 hours of time

**Nice to Have:**
- Credit card (for some services - most have free tiers)
- YouTube channel (you can create one during this guide)

### How Long Will This Take?

**Setup Time:** 4-6 hours (first time only)
**After Setup:** Just use it like any website!

**You can pause at any time and continue later.**
